# FHIR For Death Reporting

This prototype app gives medical certifiers the ability to report and
certify to jurisdiction electronic death registration systems (EDRS)
from a hospital setting. It uses [SMART on FHIR](https://smarthealthit.org/)
to pull decedent information from hospital electronic health record
(EHR) systems and
[FHIR profiles for mortality data](https://nightingaleproject.github.io/fhir-death-record/guide/index.html)
to submit information to EDRS.

This app is based on [software](https://github.com/BioMIBLab/fhir-death)
originally created as part of a collaboration between Georgia Tech and the CDC.

## Background

Mortality data is collected, analyzed, and shared by jurisdictions
across the United States to provide insight into important trends in
health, including the impact of chronic conditions, progress on
reducing deaths due to motor vehicle accidents, and the evolving
challenge of substance abuse. Medical certifiers, who determine and
certify cause of death, have access to electronic systems that contain
information about the decedent, including demographic data and medical
information relevant to determining the cause of death. By connecting
these systems that have existing data with systems used to collect
death records, and providing certifiers with easier access to the
information they need while certifying, we can reduce the burden on
certifiers, improve data quality, and improve timeliness of data
collection and reporting. This app demonstrates the use of FHIR to
both read decedent data from an EHR and submit mortality data to an
EDRS.

## Try It Out

You can see how the app works by testing it in the SMART on FHIR
Sandbox environment, using synthetic patient data. This simulates the
experience of a certifier running the app from within an EHR.

1. [Launch the App](https://launch.smarthealthit.org/ehr.html?app=https%3A%2F%2Fnightingaleproject.github.io%2Ffhir-death-refactor%2Flaunch%3Flaunch%3DeyJhIjoiMSIsImYiOiIxIn0%26iss%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flaunch.smarthealthit.org%252Fv%252Fr3%252Ffhir&user=)
2. Sign in using the pre-populated provider credentials on the login screen
3. Select a synthetic patient record from the options provided; the app itself will then launch
4. Fill out the death certificate form on each tab of the app; you can select conditions from the patient record to provide cause of death information

## Installation and Setup for Development or Testing

This is a React app bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It requires node and yarn to be installed.

To install dependencies before running for the first time, run

`yarn`
